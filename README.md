# Pokedex APP

## About the project:

This project is a Pokedex, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and powered by the PokeAPI REST service. As a big fan of Pokemon, I was excited to take on the challenge of building a functional and user-friendly Pokedex. This was also my first experience using an API REST service in a web application.

The Pokedex allows users to search for and view information about different Pokemon, including their name, type, stats, and evolution chain. I approached this project by designing a clean and intuitive user interface, which provides easy access to the various features of the Pokedex. I used JavaScript to interact with the PokeAPI REST service, allowing users to retrieve information about specific Pokemon and display it in a user-friendly manner.

Working on this project was a great opportunity for me to develop my frontend skills, including layout design, responsive web design, and JavaScript programming. It was also a chance to learn more about working with APIs and integrating third-party services into a web application.

Overall, I'm proud of the final result and I believe it's a solid solution to the challenge of creating a functional and user-friendly Pokedex. I hope it can inspire other frontend developers to explore the world of APIs and create innovative web applications.
